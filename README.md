# Rust WKD server

## What is WKD?

https://wiki.gnupg.org/WKD

## Running this project

Put your _public_ keys into `./openpgp/keys`. Files should be named like the
email address that the key is registered for.
Optionally, put your policy into a text file in `./openpgp`.

```shell
cargo build --release
./target/release/wkd-server ./openpgp/keys
```

### Usage

```
Usage: wkd-server [OPTIONS] <KEYS_PATH>

Arguments:
  <KEYS_PATH>  The path where the GPG keys are stored

Options:
      --address <ADDRESS>  [env: ADDRESS=] [default: 0.0.0.0]
      --port <PORT>        [env: PORT=] [default: 8080]
  -p, --policy <POLICY>    The path to the policy file. If not set, an empty policy is served [env: POLICY=]
  -h, --help               Print help
```

### Security

This server will refuse to serve private or invalid keys.
If a file contains a private and a public key, only the public key will be served.
Nonetheless, make sure to only include your public key.

### Deployment

You can use this `docker-compose.yaml` example file as a starting off point for your
deployment. Make sure to add your public keys as a volume.

```
services:
    wkd-server:
        image: ghcr.io/martin-fink/rust-wkd-server:latest
        volumes:
            - ./keys:/openpgp-keys:ro
        ports:
            - 127.0.0.1:8080:8080
```
